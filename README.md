In this project, I explored how Green Code principles can be applied to improve the efficiency, maintainability, and overall energy footprint of the system. Green Code is about writing software that uses fewer resources — CPU, memory, network calls, and storage — without losing functionality. The goal is to reduce unnecessary computation, avoid redundant operations, and design services that run leaner and cleaner.
I identified several opportunities to apply Green Code within this microservices architecture. This included reducing repeated REST calls between services, simplifying data transformations, and removing unused dependencies to lower processing overhead. I also optimized gateway routing, cleaned up controllers, and ensured that services return minimal payloads to reduce network traffic and improve performance. In addition, I used Lombok to make the code easier to read and maintain while reducing boilerplate code like getters and setters. Another way of reducing manual coding, I used @AllArgsConstructor in my controllers and services instead of manually adding constructor. 
I proposed specific strategies to reduce energy consuming code, such as caching frequently accessed data, minimizing blocking operations, and avoiding heavy libraries that the service doesn’t actually need. My refactoring suggestions focused on simplifying service logic, removing redundant code paths, and restructuring components to eliminate unnecessary work — all of which help the system run more efficiently.
Overall, my focus was on making the codebase lighter, faster, and more resource aware, aligning the project with modern Green Code practices.
